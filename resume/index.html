            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>Backend Engineer with ~2 years of professional experience building B2B systems and internal platforms.</p>
            <p>I specialize in Node.js and TypeScript, working with microservice-based architectures.</p>
            <p>My focus is on Clean Architecture, DDD, SOLID, and OOP, with strong attention to maintainability,</p>
            <p>scalability, and clear boundaries between domain and infrastructure. I regularly work with</p>
            <p>event-driven systems, caching, background jobs, and integrations between services.</p>
            <p>I am comfortable designing APIs, refactoring legacy code, and making architectural trade-offs</p>
            <p>based on real constraints. I care about code quality, predictable behavior, and systems that</p>
            <p>are easy to evolve, not just "working solutions".</p>
